# Mister Market

It is a project to develop an end-to-end system that can assess the current valuation level of the NIFTY50 benchmark index via statistical analysis of historical data to assist investors in making informed decisions.

The valuation level can be determined by analysis of three indicators:

* PE Ratio: It measures the current price of a stock relative to its trailing earning.

* PB Ratio: It measures the current price of a stock in comparison to its trailing book value.

* Dividend Yield Ratio: This ratio measures the current price of a stock in comparison to the dividend it has rendered.

Since a benchmark index is a weighted average of a collection of stocks, the above three ratios for it is measured accordingly. Arguably, the PB ratio is often the most stable indicator of market valuation among the three.
